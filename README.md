# House Prices in Gold Visualization

This project loads house price and gold price data, calculates house prices in ounces of gold, and visualizes the results over time.

## Setup Instructions

### Create a Python Virtual Environment

It's recommended to use a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated.

```bash
python3 -m venv houseprices
source houseprices/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 combine.py
```
## Notes
Make sure house.csv and gold.csv files are in the same directory as combine.py.

The plot will display in a window; close it to exit the script.
```
deactive    # to deactivate the environment
```
